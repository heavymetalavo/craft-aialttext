# Release Notes for AI Alt Text

## 1.5.3-unreleased
- Improve bulk action notice wording
- Improved logic to not skip generating alt text for an asset where a job is in the queue but it has a failed status
- Replacing `preSaveAsset` setting with `propogate` setting, `preSaveAsset` tried to resolve an issue where the same value could be saved over multiple sites. Could sometimes cause errors e.g. `Failed to pre-save asset: Copy-of-Copy-of-Simple-Quote-Motivational-Poster-1.png`, 
- Replacing native `file_get_contents` function with `$assets->getContents` in animated gif test, which is more reliable across asset different platforms
- Updating `OpenAiService::generateAltText()` to check a file's mime type can be sent to OpenAI API more reliably, 
- Added new `OpenAiService::generateAltText()` test to check if SVGs can be transformed to an accepted mime type
- Added new `OpenAiService::generateAltText()` test to check if resulting transform which will be sent to OpenAI is accepted mime type
