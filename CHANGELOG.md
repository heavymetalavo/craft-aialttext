# Release Notes for AI Alt Text

## 1.5.8 - 2025-06-15

- Optimised queries used to build table data on settings pages to support sites with large numbers of assets.

## 1.5.7 - 2025-05-18
- Fixed issue when processing images with square aspect ratios - where long side could be under 2000px but the short side could still be larger than 768px (the API limit) and would bypass image transforms generation with accepted dimensions.

## 1.5.6 - 2025-05-17

- Fixed issue where running **Generate all** or **Generate missing** bulk actions could generate alt text for each site **Save translated results for each site** setting was enabled

## 1.5.5 - 2025-05-16

- Update some thrown exceptions to instead become Craft wanings, turns out the API may accept other files anyway!
- Adding new test & exception for private assets with no url and unsupported mime type which cannot be transformed
- Adding test to check file size is under 20MB API limit, in super unlikely scenario where it is larger and within the required dimensions perform a transform where quality is reduced further
- Adding new test & exception for private assets with no url but require a transform as Craft does not support retreiving file contents for transforms
- Adding limitations to readme
- Update logic to support new API dimensions limitation "768px (short side) x 2000px (long side)"
- Update all queue job titles, notices and errors to only contain site ID if there is more than 1 Site
- Update bulk actions table to only show 1 "total" row where there is only 1 site

## 1.5.4 - 2025-05-09

- Removing unused variable `$extension` missed from removing the extension tests in v1.5.3

## 1.5.3 - 2025-05-09
- Improve bulk action notice wording
- Improved logic to not skip generating alt text for an asset where a job is in the queue but it has a failed status
- Replacing `preSaveAsset` setting with `propagate` setting, `preSaveAsset` tried to resolve an issue where the same value could be saved over multiple sites. Could sometimes cause errors e.g. `Failed to pre-save asset: filename.png`, 
- Replacing native `file_get_contents` function with `$assets->getContents` in animated gif test, which is more reliable across asset different platforms
- Removing tests to check an asset's file extension which is not a reliable way to ascertain if the file will be accepted by the OpenAI API
- Updating tests to check an asset's mime type to ascertain if an image transform to a different format is required before it is sent to OpenAI API
- Added new test to check if resulting transform which will be sent to OpenAI is accepted mime type
- Added new test to check if SVGs can be transformed to an accepted mime type
